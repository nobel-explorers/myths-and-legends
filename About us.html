        <P><h4>We came together randomly, but stayed for a purpose.</h4>
        In summer of 2018, eight people became a part of a project led by two amazing tutors. The idea of the project was simple enough: build your own website! But to do so in only a month, and with people who live in separate countries (did we mention our team is international?), we needed to have a lot of passion for what we were doing. And we did! Through passionate debate, we agreed that our website will be dedicated to what you can see on it today – Myths and Legends. 
        Our reasons for becoming a part of the project were different. Some of us wanted to learn to code, others wanted to show our creative side and write or design. But though we came together randomly, we enjoyed every second of it. 
        Here, come meet our team and find out why we chose to join this project and create the website!
